# Passwd-manager

It's just some easy password manager in PyQt6.
There is some encryption for your passwords, sha256 with PBKDF2 for hashing and Fernet for encryption, i think this is enough for this kind of project, but i'm open to your suggestions and ideas!

Also, i haven't tested it properly so there can be bugs. I apologize in advance for this.
